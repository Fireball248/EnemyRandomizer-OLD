# EnemyRandomizer
A working version of Kerr1291's Enemy Randomizer mod for Hollow Knight.

## Installation
Download the mod installer from the HK discord and use that to install this, although it may not be up-to-date.

OR

Find the .dll file on the modding drive from the HK discord.

This mod requires both the modding API and ModCommon, both of which can be found on the discord.

## Usage
Click the [LOAD ENEMY RANDOMIZER] button in the top-left of the main menu to load the randomizer.

## Known Bugs
If you load a save and then return to the main menu, it will soft-lock and you will have to restart the game. 
There is currently no way around this, so just try to avoid doing so.

If you have any other problems, feel free to ping me (@Fireball248) on the HK discord.

## Development
If you load the project file into an IDE, you will get many missing reference errors. To fix, add `<Path-To-Hollow Knight>\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\` to the project's references.

If you still have issues, ensure that the modding API and ModCommon are installed in your HK directory.
